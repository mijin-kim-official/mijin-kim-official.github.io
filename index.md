## About me

**What if buildings could move?** My academic journey begins with this simple question.

**Mijin Kim** is a research assistant at [ARTS](https://www.designtechlab.org/) (Architectural Research of Technology & Scientific Design Laboratory) at Korea University. Her research keywords are kinetic architecture, responsive facade, robotic construction, and human-robot collaboration. She specializes in _soft robotics / innovative materials_ and related design methodologies for architecture. During her 6-year research experience since 2018, she has engaged in several interdisciplinary projects, collaborating with Mechanical and Material Engineering experts. She has conducted various full-scale building fabrications, design projects, and robot arm studies.  

She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in Architecture through the integrated program at Ajou University. Now, she looks forward to pursuing a Ph.D. in Architecture for 2025 fall entry, further deepening her research and expanding her contributions to the field. Her current research interest is in self-assembly systems and bio-materials. She loves to bring new ideas and technologies into Architecture and share them with collaborators. 

_"I firmly believe that architects should not only design building plans but also their implementation process. Robotics' transformative impact on architecture manifests in two key ways: first, robot as a machine for living, and second, robot as a tool. As a building researcher, I always try to present a precise balance between technical knowledge and design principles through logical processes. I dream of constructing resilient, adaptive living buildings, fostering more reciprocal residential environments."_
