&nbsp; &nbsp; I’m thrilled to share that I’ve officially received my master’s degree! My thesis, titled _"Anthropomorphic Soft Robot Hand: Application in Multi-task Human-robot Collaborative Architecture"_. was an interdisciplinary project in collaboration with the Energy System Engineering Department. I’m especially grateful to Dr. R. Yeasmin for sharing her invaluable insights on self-healing material with me. This successful joint research has broadened my academic perspective, taught me how to make a good question, and helped me recognize my strengths as a building researcher.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Graduation day couldn’t have been happier! I’m so grateful for the warm congratulations and support from my amazing lab mates—love you guys all! (Our banner master TK and cake master Areum).

&nbsp; &nbsp; A heartfelt thank you to my supervisor, Dr. Hwang Yi, for his unwavering support and belief in me throughout my academic journey since 2018. 
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I also won the Dean of Graduate School prize for Best Paper Award, and the 2024 AIK Excellence Graduate Paper Award!
