The advancement of emerging technologies and materials transforms architectural practices, opening up new applications and possibilities. Over the past decade, 3D printing with ceramics has gained increasing attention within architecture due to its potential for material efficiency and the creation of unique geometric forms. In the "Digital Fabrication" class, a group of students explored computational design to create aesthetic sculptures. They prepared ceramic material for appropriate printability and fabricated their designs using the Eazao ceramic printer.

#### Digital Design Concept
&nbsp; &nbsp; My team's design began with the mathematical concept of the trefoil knot, derived from knot theory. The size of each loop was consecutively regulated, and the base geometry was lofted along the z-axis with a 10-degree rotation. Each segment was resized, forming a gentle curved surface along the section of sculptural form.

#### Material Preparation
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ceramic clay shares similarities with traditional building materials, particularly in its recyclability. However, compared to standardized construction materials like concrete, wood, and steel, ceramic has not yet been extensively studied for its potential use in 3D printing. When selecting a material for 3D printing, both printability and constructability must be considered. Excess moisture in the material can lead to deformation during printing, while overly dense material impedes smooth extrusion. Based on prior research at ARTS Lab involving bio-materials, a water content of 16% was determined to balance printability and material performance.
