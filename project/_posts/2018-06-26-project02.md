&nbsp; &nbsp; Many architectural participants have given the 3D printing technique significant attention as a new method of constructing free-form architecture. It has the potential to integrate automated construction and design processes in real-time. 
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	The design project aims to provide a creative architectural and urban space by blurring the dividing line between building, public space, and technology architecture. The abandoned old bus station on the campus was regenerated into a complex morphological design, inspiring in its new form.

#### 3D printing Technology and Free-form Architecture
&nbsp; &nbsp;	Through the fabrication process, we found crucial difficulties in applying the current 3D printing system to architecture. Because of the printing size limitation, we divided the model into printable sizes and assembled the printed pieces. Each part shrank after printing due to temperature change, resulting in considerable separation distance. Additional work was necessary to assemble the pavilion.
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	Nevertheless, we built an organic design of bus stops through 3D printing at a building scale, and we hope this project can contribute to filling the gap between the knowledge and practice of 3D printing architecture.
