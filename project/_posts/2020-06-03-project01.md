Architecture is being invigorated by the growing interest in kinetic responsive facades (KRFs). These innovative structures not only enable a dynamic style of building design but also enhance building energy efficiency and indoor comfort through morphological acclimation.
<br/>
Yet, intriguingly, despite the collective commitments to the wealth of knowledge in the design and simulation of KRFs, only a handful of constructed precedents exist, underscoring the novelty and potential of our project. 
<br/>
Our project in YoungIn, South Korea, is a testament to our commitment to innovation. We are installing a full-scale kinetic facade model with 13 modules on an experimental house. This AI-enabled responsive building facade is not just a solution but a beacon of hope, bridging the gaps in current building knowledge and practice of KRFs in architecture and paving the way for a more efficient and comfortable future.
