&nbsp; &nbsp; The geometrical inflexibility of rigid-body kinetic building facades is disadvantageous in free-form architecture. To address this problem, a gearless, lightweight, and geometrically flexible daylight-adaptive shading facade module is proposed by hybridizing gripper-shaped pneumatic elastomer and shape memory alloy(SMA) actuators.
