&nbsp; &nbsp; As part of the 'Paran Semester,' a group of students in the Architecture Department took on self-directed challenges and constructed a passive house in Moongyeong, South Korea, under the supervision of Professor Lee Kyu-In.

#### Design and Construction Development
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over 16 weeks, we delved into zero-energy housing. Utilizing SketchUp and AutoCAD, we designed floor, elevation, and section plans. Based on these drawings, we ordered eco-friendly materials from sustainable suppliers. After several site visits, we completed the structural frameworks, walls, and roof construction. As the design team leader, I organized interior design concepts proposed by our team members and conducted presentations in general meetings. Our team also compiled and purchased a list of IoT-supported furniture to enable smart home features.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The final result differed significantly from the initial design plan due to on-site conditions and work delays. The floor area decreased, and the purpose of usage changed. Therefore, we installed all purchased IoT devices and sensors inside the building constructed adjacent to ours last semester and verified their operation.
